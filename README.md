## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Git

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd kasigig
```

2. **Install dependencies**
```bash
npm install
```

3. **Set up environment** (Use Firebase Emulators - No cloud needed!)
```bash
# Copy the environment template
cp .env.example .env.local

# The default configuration uses Firebase Emulators
# No need to change anything - it works out of the box!
```

4. **Start development**
```bash
npm run dev
```

5. **Access the application**
   - **App**: http://localhost:3000
   - **Emulator UI**: http://localhost:4000

**That's it!** You're ready to develop locally with Firebase Emulators.

### 🌍 Environment Options

This project supports 3 environments:

| Environment | Use Case | Setup Required |
|-------------|----------|----------------|
| **Local (Emulators)** | Daily development | ✅ None - works out of the box |
| **Dev (kasigig-dev)** | Cloud testing | Firebase credentials needed |
| **Production (kasigig-production)** | Vercel deployment only | Never connect locally! |

📖 **For detailed environment setup**: See [ENVIRONMENTS.md](./ENVIRONMENTS.md)

### 🔧 Alternative: Use Dev Environment

If you need to test with real Firebase cloud services:

1. Get credentials from [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/kasigig-dev/settings/general)
2. Update `.env.local`:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_EMULATOR=false
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=<your_dev_api_key>
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=kasigig-dev.firebaseapp.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=kasigig-dev
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=kasigig-dev.appspot.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=<your_sender_id>
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=<your_app_id>
```
3. Run `npm run dev`

## 🧪 Local Development with Firebase Emulators

For local development, you can use Firebase Emulators to test without connecting to production Firebase services.

### Setting Up Emulators

1. **Install Firebase CLI** (if not already installed)
```bash
npm install -g firebase-tools
```

2. **Configure environment for emulators**

   Update your `.env.local` file to enable emulator mode:
```env
# Enable Firebase Emulators
NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_EMULATOR=true

# Use fake credentials for emulators
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=fake-api-key-for-emulator
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=localhost
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=demo-kasigig-production
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=demo-kasigig-production.appspot.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=123456789
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=1:123456789:web:abc123
```

3. **Start development with emulators**
```bash
npm run dev
```

This command will concurrently start:
- Firebase Emulators (Auth, Firestore, Storage)
- Next.js development server

### Accessing Emulator Services

Once running, you can access:
- **Emulator UI**: http://localhost:4000
- **Next.js App**: http://localhost:3000
- **Auth Emulator**: http://localhost:9099
- **Firestore Emulator**: http://localhost:8080
- **Storage Emulator**: http://localhost:9199

### Development vs Production Firestore Rules

The project includes two Firestore rules files:

- **`firestore.rules`**: Production rules with proper security (used by default)
- **`firestore.dev.rules`**: Development rules with open access (for local testing only)

**Important**: The Firebase emulator loads rules from the file specified in `firebase.json` (default: `firestore.rules`). If you need to test with open rules locally:

```bash
# Temporarily switch to dev rules (local testing only!)
cp firestore.rules firestore.rules.backup
cp firestore.dev.rules firestore.rules

# After testing, restore production rules
cp firestore.rules.backup firestore.rules
rm firestore.rules.backup
```

**Never commit open development rules to production!**

### Switching Between Local and Production

To switch back to production Firebase:

1. Update `.env.local`:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_USE_EMULATOR=false
# Add your real Firebase credentials
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_real_api_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_project.firebaseapp.com
# ... etc
```

2. Restart the development server

## 🚀 PRE-LAUNCH CHECKLIST & NEXT STEPS

### 🔴 CRITICAL - Must Complete Before Launch (Week 1-2)

#### 1. Secure Digital Assets (Day 1-2) 🔒
**Cost**: R100-3,000 | **Priority**: IMMEDIATE

- [ ] **Register kasigig.co.za domain** (R99/year)
  - Providers: [Afrihost](https://www.afrihost.com/domains) or [Register.co.za](https://www.register.co.za/)
  - Alternative: kasigig.africa (R249/year)
- [ ] **Check kasigig.com availability** (for future expansion)
- [ ] **Secure social media handles**: @kasigig on Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, LinkedIn
  - Register ALL handles today to prevent squatting

#### 2. File Trademark Application (Day 1-3) 📋
**Cost**: R2,990 | **Priority**: HIGH

- [ ] File SA trademark via [BrandLaw](https://www.brandlaw.co.za/)
- [ ] Class 42 (Software/Platform services)
- [ ] Processing time: 6-12 months (file NOW before public launch)

#### 3. Configure Vercel CI/CD (Day 2-3) 🔧
**Priority**: HIGH - Prevent broken deployments

- [ ] **Configure Vercel to block deploys on failures**
  - Settings → Git → Ignored Build Step
  - Enable "Cancel deployment if build command exits with error"
  - Add build command: `npm run test:ci && npx tsc --noEmit`
  - This ensures no broken code reaches production

#### 4. Deploy Production Security Rules (Day 3-5) 🔐
**Priority**: CRITICAL - CANNOT GO LIVE WITHOUT THIS

```bash
# Review production rules
cat firestore.rules

# Deploy to Firebase
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
firebase deploy --only storage

# Test in Firebase Console: Firestore → Rules → Test
```

**Verification checklist:**
- [ ] Users can only read/write their own data
- [ ] Employers can only manage their own gigs
- [ ] Applications restricted to applicant and employer
- [ ] Profile photos upload correctly with size limits
- [ ] ID documents properly secured (no public access)

**⚠️ Current Status**: Development rules are OPEN - MUST deploy production rules!

#### 3.5 Configure Vercel CI Checks (Day 3-5) 🔧
**Priority**: HIGH - Prevent broken deployments

In Vercel Project Settings → Git:
- [ ] Enable "Ignored Build Step" with custom command:
  ```bash
  npx tsc --noEmit && exit 0 || exit 1
  ```
- [ ] OR configure in `vercel.json`:
  ```json
  {
    "buildCommand": "npm run build",
    "ignoreCommand": "npx tsc --noEmit"
  }
  ```
- [ ] Enable "Deployment Protection" for production branch
- [ ] Test by pushing a commit with type errors (should block deployment)

**Why this matters**: Prevents deploying broken code to production when TypeScript errors exist.

#### 4. Firebase Production Setup (Day 3-5) 🔥

- [x] Create production Firebase project `kasigig-production`
- [ ] Update `.firebaserc` with new project ID
- [ ] Enable services: Authentication, Firestore, Storage
- [ ] Configure Authentication:
  - [ ] Enable Email/Password provider
  - [ ] Add authorized domains (kasigig.co.za, kasigig.com)
  - [ ] Customize email templates (verification, password reset)
  - [ ] Enable email verification requirement
- [ ] Set up Firebase billing alerts (prevent surprise costs)

#### 5. Google Cloud OCR Setup (Day 4-5) 🔍

## 📋 Development Roadmap (Post-Launch)

### High Priority (Enhanced Features)
- [x] **Payment system integration** with escrow for completed work ✅
- [x] **Payment dashboard** for earnings tracking and financial reporting ✅
- [x] **Fee management system** with configurable platform fees ✅
- [ ] **Job seeker profile viewing** - Employers can't view applicant profiles when reviewing applications. Need to show full profile (work history, skills, reviews, verification) so employers can make informed hiring decisions.
- [ ] **Manage Gigs dashboard & completion workflow** - Button exists but functionality not implemented. Employers need to view/edit/close their posted gigs. Critical missing feature: ability to mark gig as "completed" which triggers payment release from escrow to worker. Without this, payments remain stuck in escrow even after work is done. Should show gig status, application count, ability to mark as completed/cancelled.
- [ ] **Browse Talent page** - Currently "Browse Talent" redirects to Browse Gigs instead of showing job seeker profiles. Employers need to proactively find workers by skills, location, ratings, verification status.
- [ ] **Application withdrawal** - Allow job seekers to withdraw their pending applications for any reason. Gives workers control and flexibility if they find another job, change their mind, or circumstances change. Important for informal sector where opportunities can come up quickly.
- [ ] **Max applicants limit** - Let employers specify how many applicants they want to review (e.g., "5 applicants max"). Shows job seekers "3/5 applicants" so they know if it's worth applying. Auto-closes gig to "reviewing" when limit reached. Critical for informal work where employers typically choose from first 3-5 applicants.
- [ ] **Firestore security rules** implementation for production
- [ ] **Review and rating system** with trust building features
- [ ] **Milestone-based payments** for project-based work enhancement

### Medium Priority (Enhanced Features)
- [ ] **Enhanced verification rollout** (Q2 2025) with background checks
- [ ] **Premium verification launch** (Q3 2025) with full reference checks
- [ ] **Skills hub expansion** with micro-learning modules
- [ ] **Advanced search filters** (location safety zones, skills matching)
- [ ] **Emergency contact integration** for family safety networks
- [ ] **Check-in safety system** for active gigs

### Future Enhancements (Scale & Impact)
- [ ] **AI-powered safety monitoring** for platform interactions and risk assessment
- [ ] **Full multi-language platform** (Afrikaans, isiZulu, isiXhosa, Sesotho for complete accessibility)
- [ ] **Government integration** for national employment and skills development programs
- [ ] **Community partnerships** with NGOs, training centers, and local organizations
- [ ] **Employer verification** system for enhanced worker protection
- [ ] **Regional expansion** to other African informal economy markets
- [ ] **Impact measurement** tools for social and economic ROI tracking
- [ ] **Skills certification partnerships** with formal education institutions

## 🔧 Known Issues

- Warning about Next.js SWC dependencies (cosmetic, doesn't affect functionality)
- Demo data shown when Firebase database is empty (by design)

## 🔐 Firebase Security

### Firestore Security Rules (Recommended)
```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Users can read and write their own data
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
      allow read: if request.auth != null; // Allow others to read basic profile info
    }

    // Gigs are readable by all authenticated users
    match /gigs/{gigId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == resource.data.employerId;
    }

    // Applications
    match /applications/{applicationId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null &&
        (request.auth.uid == resource.data.applicantId ||
         request.auth.uid == resource.data.employerId);
    }

    // Reviews
    match /reviews/{reviewId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == resource.data.reviewerId;
    }
  }
}
```
